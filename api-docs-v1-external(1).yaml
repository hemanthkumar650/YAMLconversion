        One of <strong>driverId</strong> or <strong>assetId</strong> fields is required in the input<br>
        Status of upload requests can be fetched using the GET Trip Details API by passing the
        'includeUploadRequests' query parameter 
        <br/><br/>
        A time-lapse version of the video can be fetched using the 'enableTimelapse' query parameter. <br/>General data cost of time-lapse video at various configurations for a one hour long video is mentioned below in the table:
        <br/>

        <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-color="#CCC" cellpadding="10"> <tbody> <tr> <td> Video Resolution </td><td> Video Quality </td><td> Capture Interval (in secs) </td><td> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;" >Approximate video file size in MB<br/> (which is transferred to server)</span > </p></td></tr><tr> <td> 1280x720 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 100 </td></tr><tr> <td> 1280x720 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 65 </td></tr><tr> <td> 1280x720 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 10 </td></tr><tr> <td> 1280x720 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 6.5 </td></tr><tr> <td> 640x360 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 45 </td></tr><tr> <td> 640x360 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 22 </td></tr><tr> <td> 640x360 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 4.5 </td></tr><tr> <td> 640x360 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 2.2 </td></tr><tr> <td> 320x180 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 15 </td></tr><tr> <td> 320x180 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 9 </td></tr><tr> <td> 320x180 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 1.5 </td></tr><tr> <td> 320x180 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 1 </td></tr></tbody></table>

        <br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Video-duration is determined by the start and stop time provided in the DVR request. For a time-lapse of entire trip, the video-duration is the trip-duration.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong>The data size of the time-lapse video scales directly with the capture-interval. Display interval has no bearing on the final video size. However it governs the time-lapse video duration.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Starting from APK version 1.7.0, "oldestDvrTimestamp" is available via <a href="/docs/device#tag/Device-State-and-Tracking/paths/~1device-management~1devices~1{deviceId}~1device-tracking-events/get">Device-Tracking-Events API</a>
        under the "Device-Storage" event type. Input startTimeUTC must be greater than the oldestDvrTimestamp of the device, if available.
        This is to fail fast when the requested time range is not serviceable and avoid delayed `UNAVAILABLE` failures.<br><br>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Starting from APK version 1.14.0, collage based DVR is supported.<br>

        Reading messages automatically moves the cursor forward. To read them again, the cursor has to be reset using the
        Reset Cursor Position API.<br>
        Messages uploaded by devices will be available for seven days, after which they are deleted forever.<br>
        The internal message queue is a distributed system and the global order of messages is not maintained. However,
        all messages generated by any given device ID will be ordered by <em>ingestionTimestamp</em>.

        Devices belonging to `DISABLED` fleets will not be allowed to use LM services and hence cannot upload
        trip data to the cloud. Such devices will still record trips and store information locally for ten
        days, after which no new trips will be recorded. All trip data saved on the devices will be purged
        sixty days after the fleet is disabled. Trip data previously uploaded to the cloud will still be available.
        When a fleet is re-enabled, devices will start functioning normally again and any data on their disks that
        is not already in the cloud is then uploaded.<br>
        All fleets are `ENABLED` by default.

    description: >
      Face-based driver verification is supported on Rideview APK v1.7.0 and above. One driver identification check is done
      per each trip, 15 minutes after trip start. These checks are limited to 200 trips per month per device (with Pro+ or Advanced
      packages), pooled at fleet level.

  - name: Rate Limiting
    description: >
      As API developers, we need to make sure our APIs are running as
      efficiently as possible. Otherwise, everyone using our services will
      suffer from degraded performance, and denial of service in severe
      instances. We enforce API rate limiting under the following guidelines
      to maintain consistent and scalable performance of our systems, while also
      safeguarding against DDoS vulnerabilities.<br><br>
      For API requests, you can make up to 3000 requests per hour, for every
      1000 registered assets. Additionally, we enforce a burst-rate limit
      of 10 requests per second per 1000 assets, limiting the maximum number of
      requests that can be serviced in a one-second window. When
      assessing rate limits, total number of registered assets are rounded to
      the nearest multiple of 1000 - e.g. for 1400 assets, the rate limit
      enforced will be equivalent to 1000 assets (3000 requests/hr), and for
      1600 assets, the rate limit enforced will be equivalent to 2000
      assets (6000 requests/hr.). A limit of 3000 requests per hour, and 10
      requests per second will be supported in case the number of
      registered assets is less than 500.<br><br>

      <u>Livestreaming usage limits</u><br>
      100 minutes of viewing per device per month, with 24 hour data retention
      (updated 20th Dec 2021)</strong>. More minutes can be provisioned via the asset API (input field&colon;
      recurringLivestreamExtraMinutes).<br>
      Livestream minutes used are calculated as sum of (views on stream * stream upload duration). For example, on a device
      in a given month&colon; if one 10-minute livestream was viewed twice and another 15-minute livestream was viewed once,
      then the total minutes used on the device for that month will be (10 &#x2a; 2) + (15 &#x2a; 1) = 35
